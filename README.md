#Stitch

Stitch is a modern revisitation to our childhood dreams of imaginary pets and tamagotchis. The idea was to take a game that we were all familiar with as kids and bring it to a modern platform, Facebook Messenger.

Stitch has a health, hunger and happiness meter that can be replenished through certain commands. It will send you a Facebook message if its health/hunger/happiness dips below a threshold and must checked on every few hours to keep it alive.

Stitch was written in Python with Flask. It integrates the Facebook Messenger API and is deployed by Heroku.

This was a hackathon project created by myself and [lawrence](https://github.com/lvwrence) at Hack Western 3.
